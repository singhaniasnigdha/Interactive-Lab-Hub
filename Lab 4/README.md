# Ph-UI!!!

For lab this week, we focus on the prototyping the physical look and feel of the device. The parts across Lab 1 and Lab 2 have been merged to make the reading more coherent.

## The Report

### Part A. Capacitive Sensing

We use the [capacitive sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-gator) in this experiment. At boot it measures the capacitance on each of the 12 contacts. Whenever that capacitance changes it considers it a user touch. We attach conductive fabric, to build our own [morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) interpreter.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/singhaniasnigdha/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%204/imgs/cap_sensor.png" height="240" /></p>

The capacitive sensor board is connected to the raspberry pi using the qwiic connectors. Then alligator clips are used to attach small strips of conductive sheet to 2 nodes (in our case 8 and 10.) In the image above, the yellow clip represents the `dit` (morse sound for dot) and the black clip is the `dah` (morse for dash). The code is available at `cap_morse.py`.

### Part B. OLED screen

We also use the [Adafruit OLED Screens](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306/tree/master/examples) to display the decoded alphabets/numbers received from the capacitive sensor-based Morse Generator. The code for the same can be found at `oled_morse.py`.

I use a spoon to touch the conductive sheet, as I realise that the system is more robust when the touch occurs using the spoon than my finger.

### Part C. Paper Display

Things needed to build the paper prototype:
* Cardboard
* Olfa Knife and Cutting Board
* Glue
* Ruler and Markers
* Tape
 
A sheet of cardboard is marked with the following dimensions to create the box which holds the Raspberry Pi. The edges are then glued together to create an open box.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/singhaniasnigdha/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%204/imgs/box.png" height="240" /></p>

To build the numpad, 10 1cm-edge squares are cut to provide a raised platform to simulate the feel of a button. A printout of the T9-keypad is used as stickers on these buttons to guide the user about which letters are associated with which number. Finally, two button in the shape of a circle and rectangle are cut out, to denote the Morse symbols.

**b. Make a video of your paper display in action.**

**Rationale for the Design**: A design similar to older mobile phones with a T9 keypad is used as inspiration for this device. Familiarity with using these mobile phones for typing text messages will make it easy for the user to adapt to it. In addition to the T9 keypad, a button in the shape of a circle (representing the Morse `dit`) and another button in the shape of a rectangle (for `dah`) are used to make it intuitive.

It should be small and handy. The dimensions of the device are kept to a minimum to only hold the keypad, screen and the Raspberry Pi. It would have been ideal to have a slimmer device, but the thickness of the Raspberry Pi was a constraint in this regard.


### Part D. Materiality

**Choice of Material**:  Cardboard was used to build the prototype for this device because it is inexpensive, versatile and can be cut, folded, and shaped with at-home equipment. By using an Olfa knife, it is easy to make a box out of a small sheet of cardboard, which is good enough to contain the Raspberry Pi, the T9-keypad (used to input the message), and additional sensors.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/singhaniasnigdha/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%204/imgs/material.png" height="240" /></p>

The capacitive touch sensor, OLED screen and red button are placed on a small sheet of cardboard. Next, a small rectangular box is built to store the Raspberry Pi. Small cutouts are made on the side of this box to allow for a power cord and a 3.5mm audio jack. 

The sheet holding the sensors is taped onto one of the side of the cardboard, such that it is easy to slide the Pi in and out of the device, and/or connect it with other sensors. 

**Other Alternatives**:  As devices of this kind are usually made of metal or plaastic, they were considered to build the prototype. Plastic Sheets were discarded because they are not environment friendly, while cardboard is bio-degradable and easily available at everyone's houses. Metal sheets are also not particularly friendly to the environment, but they are extremely complicated to cut, mold and shape.

### Part E. 'Looks-Like' Prototype

### Part F. 'Works-Like' Prototype

Sensors/Devices used for making this prototype include: 
* Raspberry Pi, 
* OLED Display
* Red LED Button
* Capacitive Touch Sensor
* Conductive Tape

The code for this experiment can be found at `morse.py`.

### Part G. 'Acts-Like' Prototype


### Part H. Reflections
This assignment emphasizes on the value of interactive device design in addition to its functionality. It is important the user finds it intuitive to use the device. Building a working prototype required a lot of strategizing and several iterations. 

Some things that could have better are:
* **Neater design** - First experience with cardboard prototyping, hence the edges are not as clean as they could have been. The conductive tape is visible, which is not pleasant to the eye.
* **Capacitive Touch Sensor** - The sensor used for prototyping this experiment is not very robust. It misses several touches and also counts them multiple times on some occassions. The device would work more effectively if the sensors could detect every capacitive change more accurately.
* **Bigger Screen** - The words coded/encoded using Morse had to be restricted to a few letters due the dimension constraints of the screen, which is less than 3cm in length. It would have been interesting to explore coding/encoding sentences.

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Sketches/photos of device designs
1. "Looks like" prototypes: show us what how the device should look, feel, sit, weigh, etc.
3. "Works like" prototypes: show us what the device can do
4. "Acts like" prototypes: videos/storyboards/other means of showing how a person would interact with the device
